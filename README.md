# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description
This app allows the user to visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm using a grid. The user selects the start and target node of the grid and is given the option to build walls or a maze. They can then choose which algorithm they want to visualize.

With this app, it is easy to see and compare both algorithms as they work in real-time to find the destination target node and then draw out the shortest path there. 

## Features
- Allows for creation of walls where algorithm cannot access
- Allows for creation of maze using recursive division
- Start and target nodes can be moved to any location on the grid

## How to Use
1. Download zip file of repo
2. Extract the files
3. Open the terminal on your computer
4. Navigate to the parent folder of the project - jamming (not jamming-main) using the `cd` command
5. Type `npm install` into the terminal and wait for the installation to complete
6. Type `npm start` to open application on 'http://localhost:3000'
7. Begin visualizing
